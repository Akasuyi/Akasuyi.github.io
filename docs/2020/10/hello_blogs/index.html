		<h2 id="hello-blogs">Hello blogs!</h2>
<p>I am currently working on my homepage and updating my github profile these days.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really had good habits of writing things I have learned and reorganized in the past 20 years, but I want to do so in the future, not only to urge myself to think more deeply, but also to share with others. Hope these blogs can save your time and hopefully help you come up with bright ideas!</p>
<p>Blogs about NLP and some other tech or math will be written mainly in English, for my own writing practice, but I will make an endeavor to upload a Chinese version as well.</p>
<h2 id="dos-and-donts">Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts</h2>
<p>Here some do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts I want to stick to in my blogs</p>
<ul>
<li>List prerequisites needed to understand the texts, and although these prerequisites reader should already be familiar to, there should be some introduction about them too, but always keep them simple and readable.</li>
<li>List what readers are expected to see in this blogs, save their time read materials that of no use to them.</li>
<li>keep blogs in a good structure, balance the depth and breath of blogs. Even if readers don&rsquo;t understand some advance material, they can continue reading without being daunt. Hope readers will enjoy these blogs like reading detective stories.</li>
<li>High-level intuition should make someone without knowledge in this field understood, specific tech details should withstand the tests of peer review.</li>
<li>Since I am not an L1 learner in English, there will be mistakes in syntax, misuse or something else. But I will try my best to avoid that.</li>
</ul>
